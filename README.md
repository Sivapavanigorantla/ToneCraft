🌸 **SakuraPolish** is a gentle, light-themed Generative AI application that rewrites a single sentence into a chosen tone — **Polite**, **Friendly**, or **Professional**.

Live Deployment at: https://tonecraft-3lfkkmfboxumhww5ovchqh.streamlit.app/

Built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Google Gemini**, the app focuses on clarity, emotional safety, and simplicity. Users type one sentence, select a tone, and receive a calm, respectful rewrite without altering the original meaning.

Designed with a soft sakura-and-cherry color palette, SakuraPolish avoids visual and linguistic harshness, making it suitable for users who prefer a soothing, non-overwhelming experience.

✨ **Key Highlights**

* Minimal, single-purpose Generative AI
* Clean and uplifting UI (light theme)
* No chat memory, no complexity, no distractions
* Beginner-friendly codebase
* Ready for instant deployment on Streamlit Cloud

SakuraPolish demonstrates how Generative AI can be used responsibly — not to replace writing, but to gently refine it.
